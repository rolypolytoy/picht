Picht Tutorial
=====================

This tutorial contains examples demonstrating how to use Picht, moving up from basic cylindrical electrodes, to 
understanding the properties of unipotential lenses, to finally being able to design and chain complex multi-lens systems.

Begin at electrode creation, work your way through the unipotential lens series, and then try your hand at the SEM example.
