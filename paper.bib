abstract = {Covering the last half of the 20th century, we present some of the basic and well-known results for the SOR theory and related methods as well as some that are not as well known. Most of the earlier results can be found in the excellent books by Varga (Matrix Iterative Analysis, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1962) Young (Iterative Solution of Large Linear systems, Academic Press, New York, 1971) and Berman and Plemmons (Nonnegative Matrices in the Mathematical Sciences, SIAM, Philadelphia, PA, 1994) while some of the most recent ones are given in the bibliography of this paper. In this survey, both the point and the block SOR methods are considered for the solution of a linear system of the form Ax=b, where A∈Cn,n and b∈Cn⧹{0}. Some general results concerning the SOR and related methods are given and also some more specific ones in cases where A happens to possess some further property, e.g., positive definiteness, L-, M-, H-matrix property, p-cyclic consistently ordered property etc.}

abstract = {The thermionic cathode emission properties of an ultrafine tungsten filament are investigated with the accurate filament temperature (T) measured by an infrared pyrometer. The results show that the tungsten filament begins to emit electrons at T of about 1800 K, and the maximum electron emission efficiency (∼20 mA/W) occurs at T of about 2900 K. Moreover, the effective filament area for electron emission reaches saturation after T exceeds 2700 K. For a tungsten hot-cathode, a using standard is recommended that its operating temperature should not exceed 2600 K, the electron emission current density should not exceed 0.5 A/cm2, and the electron emission efficiency should be less than 5 mA/W. Additionally, the relation between the thermal emissivity of tungsten filament and T is also studied, showing a nearly linear increase of the thermal emissivity from 0.23 to 0.31 with T increasing from 1700 K to 2500 K and a saturated thermal emissivity of 0.48 at T of about 2900 K.}
