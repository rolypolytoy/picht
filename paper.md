# Summary

Electron optics is the field of physics that deals with the study of electron and ion beams under the influence of electric and magnetic 'lenses'. Electromagnetic lenses are called 'lenses' because they make charged particle beams converge, diverge and reflect, in a way analogous to how optical lenses affect beams of light.  Electron optics is an important field of modern science, and is an integral part of the operations of many machines including electron microscopes, ion implantation and milling machines, and mass spectrometers. Picht provides researchers and engineers with the ability to design and simulate such systems, to reduce the barrier of entry to perform meaningful research in this field.
