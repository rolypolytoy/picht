        "\n# Full-Scale SEM Simulation\n\nHere's a full simulation of an electrostatic lens-only scanning electron microscope (SEM), where we combine\nelectrostatic lenses, einzel lenses, and complex acceleration, focusing and defocusing behaviors in one instance. We chain together several\nelectrodes, a condenser (einzel) lens, and an objective (einzel) lens and observe two full crossovers- that's where the beams make an X.\nNote how because of the clean-ness of the design, it looks like two clean lines- this isn't because we've parameterized the beam this way, but because\nof the electron optics at play. Tinker with the parameters here, see how things change. Note: You'll have to zoom in for this, because the default system is WAY too small to see.\nLearn to use matplotlib's visualization tools to better understand the system.\n\nSome design decisions we've made for full physical realism include: 0.1 eV beam initialization to mimic thermionic emission from tungsten\n5kV accelerating voltage from a hairpin cathode, with -100V biased Wehnelt Cylinders.\nA -7200V condenser lens and a -10,000V objective lens.\nThree total crossover points of increasing tightness.\n"
